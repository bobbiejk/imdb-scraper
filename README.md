# Netflix popularity

__What content on Netflix has the highest popularity?

## Motivation

The purpose of this research is to gain insight into whether Netflix original,
exclusive and/or simultaneously released content is more popular compared to 
other content in the Netflix library. This popularity is measured by the amount and
valence of reviews. This project helps to understand the current dynamics of
creating popular content in the streaming video on demand market. Considering 
that acquiring popular, licensed content versus producing new titles can be highly
costly, this research clarifies whether such content strategy is fruitful in terms
of popularity. 

## Method

The data collected in this research is originated from IMDb and TMDb. These websites
provide an overview of content-specific information including the distributors involved,
producers involved, release dates and reviews written. These variables are needed in 
order to assess whether content is exclusive (Netflix is only distributor), original
(Netflix is one of the producers), simultaneously released (entire season is released
at once) or whether the review has been written one week or after one week of release.
It is analyzed what content strategy (original, exclusive, simultaneous release) reaps
the greatest benefits in terms of popularity, and how popularity of content decreases
over the subsequent weeks of releasing.
